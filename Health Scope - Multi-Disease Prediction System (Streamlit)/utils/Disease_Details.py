            Diabetes is a condition where the body struggles to process sugar (glucose) from food. 
            Normally, insulin helps move sugar from the blood into cells for energy. In diabetes, 
            either the body doesn't produce enough insulin or can't use it effectively, leading to 
            high blood sugar levels. There are two main types: Type 1 diabetes (where the body doesn't 
            produce insulin) and Type 2 diabetes (where the body doesn't use insulin properly). 
            Over time, high blood sugar can lead to serious problems with our heart, eyes, kidneys, 
            nerves, and more.

            Heart disease includes various conditions that affect the heart, with coronary artery disease

            heart attacks, or worse. However, many forms of heart disease can be prevented or managed

            Kidney disease occurs when your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood effectively. 
            These bean-shaped organs remove waste, balance minerals, make urine, and regulate blood pressure.
            Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means lasting damage that can get worse over time. If the damage is 
            very bad, your kidneys may stop working completely. This is called kidney failure, and you would 
            need dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Many people don't realize they have kidney disease 
            until it's advanced because symptoms often don't appear until the kidneys are badly damaged.
