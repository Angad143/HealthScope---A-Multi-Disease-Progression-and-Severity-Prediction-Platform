# HealthScope - A Multi-Disease Progression and Severity Prediction Platform

## **📌 Project Overview**
HealthScope is a **web-based application** built using **Streamlit** that predicts the progression and severity of multiple diseases, including **Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Kidney Disease**. It also features an **AI Health Assistant** to provide insights based on user inputs.

## Features 🚀
- **Disease Prediction**: Predicts the severity of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Kidney Disease.
- **AI Health Assistant (DeepSeek or Google Generative AI)**: Provides medical insights using AI.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Simple and interactive web interface.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Get instant results based on your input data.

## How to Use 🏥
1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. **Navigate through the App**
   - Use the **sidebar** to select different prediction models.
   - Enter your health details and get predictions.
   - Chat with the **AI Health Assistant** for medical queries.
