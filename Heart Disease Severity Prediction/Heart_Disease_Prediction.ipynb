    "\n",
    "#### **Introduction**  \n",
    "Heart disease is a serious health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and severity prediction can help in better treatment and prevention. This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the severity of heart disease based on different health factors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Project Overview**  \n",
    "The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle: [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arezaei81/heartcsv). It contains various medical features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more, which help determine heart disease severity. The project involves cleaning the data, performing analysis, and using classification models to make predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Objectives**  \n",
    "- Understand and analyze the dataset.  \n",
    "- Clean and preprocess the data.  \n",
    "- Apply different classification models for prediction.  \n",
    "- Compare model performance using accuracy.  \n",
    "- Deploy the best model for real-world usage."
