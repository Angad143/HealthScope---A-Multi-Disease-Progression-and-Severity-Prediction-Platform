        <h2>Heart Disease</h2>
        <p><span class="section-title">What is Heart Disease?</span> Heart disease refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart, including coronary artery disease, heart attacks, arrhythmias, and heart failure. It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.</p>
        
        <p><span class="section-title">Types of Heart Disease:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Coronary Artery Disease:</strong> Narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle.</li>
            <li><strong>Heart Attack:</strong> Occurs when blood flow to part of the heart is blocked, leading to damage to the heart muscle.</li>
            <li><strong>Arrhythmias:</strong> Abnormal heart rhythms that can lead to inefficient pumping of the heart.</li>
            <li><strong>Heart Failure:</strong> A condition where the heart can't pump blood effectively to meet the body's needs.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><span class="section-title">Causes:</span> The primary causes include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, sedentary lifestyle, and excessive alcohol consumption.</p>
        
        <p><span class="section-title">Prevention:</span> Maintain a healthy diet, exercise regularly, manage stress, avoid smoking, and keep blood pressure and cholesterol levels in check.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Diabetes Section -->
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Diabetes</h2>
        <p><span class="section-title">What is Diabetes?</span> Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the body is unable to produce or effectively use insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. It can lead to serious complications if not managed properly.</p>
        
        <p><span class="section-title">Types of Diabetes:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type 1 Diabetes:</strong> An autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.</li>
            <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes:</strong> A condition where the body becomes resistant to insulin, often associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle.</li>
            <li><strong>Gestational Diabetes:</strong> Diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and usually goes away after childbirth but increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><span class="section-title">Symptoms:</span> Frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow healing of wounds.</p>
        
        <p><span class="section-title">Management:</span> Diabetes can be managed with a healthy diet, regular physical activity, blood sugar monitoring, and medications such as insulin or oral medications.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Kidney Disease Section -->
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Kidney Disease</h2>
        <p><span class="section-title">What is Kidney Disease?</span> Kidney disease, or chronic kidney disease (CKD), refers to the gradual loss of kidney function over time. The kidneys play a critical role in filtering waste from the blood, and when they fail, waste builds up in the body.</p>
        
        <p><span class="section-title">Types of Kidney Disease:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):</strong> A long-term condition where kidney function gradually declines, often due to diabetes or hypertension.</li>
            <li><strong>Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):</strong> A sudden loss of kidney function due to injury or illness, but often reversible with treatment.</li>
            <li><strong>Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD):</strong> A genetic disorder characterized by cysts in the kidneys that can lead to kidney failure.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><span class="section-title">Symptoms:</span> Swelling, fatigue, frequent urination changes, nausea, and high blood pressure.</p>
        
        <p><span class="section-title">Prevention and Treatment:</span> Control diabetes and high blood pressure, follow a kidney-friendly diet, avoid smoking, and consider dialysis or a kidney transplant in severe cases.</p>
